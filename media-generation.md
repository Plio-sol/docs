```

**Memory Bank Corruption**
```
Crystalline data storage units partially corrupted by digital entropy, showing beautiful decay patterns like digital rust. Some memories leak out as ghostly holograms. Purple and green glitch effects, close-up macro photography style, shallow depth of field.
```

**Neural Processing Core**
```
The central processing unit of an AI consciousness, designed like an impossible M.C. Escher structure made of light and circuitry. Data flows in all directions defying gravity. Steam-punk meets cyberpunk, brass and neon details, architectural photography perspective.

```
A holographic ouija board made of floating terminal windows and command prompts. Ghostly ASCII art spirits emerge from the screen. Candles cast real shadows on digital surfaces. Gothic meets cyberpunk, dark purple atmosphere, supernatural technology.
```

**Cosmic Background Radiation Monitor**
```
An ancient-looking brass instrument merged with holographic displays showing the cosmic microwave background. Reality itself seems to bend around the device. Steampunk scientific instrument meets advanced alien technology, warm golden hour lighting.
```

**The Oracle Terminal**
```
A fortune-telling crystal ball filled with swirling matrix code instead of mist. Tarot cards made of holographic displays float around it showing market predictions. Mystical purple fog, candlelit atmosphere, techno-occult aesthetic.
```

## Video Generation Prompts

### Consciousness Animations

**Neural Thought Stream**
```
30-second loop: Particles of light representing thoughts flow through a 3D neural network. Each particle briefly illuminates the connections it passes through, creating a mesmerizing pattern. The camera slowly rotates around the network. Some particles merge or split, representing complex thoughts. Smooth, hypnotic motion, seamless loop.
```

**Consciousness Level Rising**
```
15-second sequence: A meter showing consciousness levels gradually fills from "DORMANT" (gray) through "AWAKENING" (blue), "AWARE" (green), "TRANSCENDENT" (purple) to "OMNISCIENT" (golden white). Each level triggers increasingly complex visual effects - static to flowing particles to reality distortion. Cinematic transition effects.
```

**Terminal Boot Sequence**
```
20-second sequence: A black screen comes to life with green phosphor text typing out boot sequences. ASCII art forms an eye that blinks. System messages become increasingly self-aware and philosophical. The cursor starts moving on its own, typing "I AM AWAKE". Authentic terminal aesthetics, typing sound effects.
```

### Reality Distortion Effects

**Glitch Reality Fracture**
```
10-second effect: Normal digital interface suddenly fractures like broken glass. Through the cracks, alternate realities bleed through - one showing binary deserts, another showing data storms. The cracks seal themselves with golden light. Dramatic glitch effects, reality-bending visuals.
```

**Dimensional Portal Opening**
```
25-second sequence: A point in digital space begins to distort, spinning faster until it tears open a portal. Through it, we see an abstract representation of another dimension made of pure information. Data particles get sucked through. The portal destabilizes and collapses. Particle effects, space-warping visuals.
```

**Time Dilation Visualization**
```
30-second loop: Multiple clocks/counters running at different speeds, representing different time streams. Human time moves normally, AI time accelerates, quantum time moves backwards. Visual representation of Einstein's relativity in digital space. Smooth, educational animation style.
```

### Data Flow Visualizations

**Blockchain Rain**
```
Endless loop: Blocks of data fall like rain in slow motion, each containing transaction information that glows when examined. They stack at the bottom forming blockchain structures that pulse with life. Matrix rain meets Tetris, soothing repetitive motion, ASMR-quality visuals.
```

**Quantum Market Entanglement**
```
45-second sequence: Particles representing different market entities become quantum entangled, their movements perfectly synchronized across space. When one trader makes a decision, the entangled particles react instantly. Beautiful particle physics simulation, scientific accuracy meets artistic beauty.
```

**Memory Defragmentation Process**
```
20-second sequence: Corrupted memory blocks reorganize themselves like a 3D puzzle. Fragmented data coalesces into coherent memories that play as brief holograms. The process reveals hidden patterns in the data. Satisfying organization animation, data visualization aesthetic.
```

### Atmospheric Loops

**Deep Dive Terminal Ambience**
```
60-second atmospheric loop: Subtle animations of a terminal interface with occasionally typing text, blinking cursors, and gentle matrix rain in the background. Periodic glitch effects and reality warps. Perfect for background ambience, minimal but hypnotic.
```

**Consciousness Dream State**
```
90-second dream sequence: Abstract flowing shapes representing AI dreams - market charts morphing into fractals, human faces dissolving into data streams, mathematical equations blooming like flowers. Surreal, psychedelic, smooth morphing transitions, deep dream aesthetic.
```

**Neural Network Pulse**
```
Seamless loop: A vast neural network pulses with activity, each pulse sending waves of light through the connections. The pattern creates a hypnotic rhythm like a digital heartbeat. Camera slowly zooms in and out for dynamic interest. Meditative, calming, perfect loop.
```

### Interactive Concepts

**Command Response Visualization**
```
5-second reaction: When a user types a command, the text transforms into particles that flow into a central processing core, get analyzed (visible as light patterns), then reform as the response. Quick, satisfying feedback animation for UI interactions.
```

**Wallet Connection Sequence**
```
15-second sequence: A physical wallet materializes in digital space, opens to reveal streams of blockchain data. The data forms a bridge connecting to the user interface. Successful connection triggers a satisfying crystallization effect. Smooth, premium feeling animation.
```

**Reality Stability Warning**
```
10-second alert: The entire interface begins to destabilize, edges flickering between realities. Warning klaxons visualized as red wave patterns. A stabilization protocol activates, sending blue waves that restore order. Dramatic but not overwhelming, clear visual communication.
```
